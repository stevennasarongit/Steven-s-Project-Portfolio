									Scavenger Hunt</h1>
									<p>Exploring the Brandeis campus to document thoughtful design choices and overlooked barriers in our built environment.</p>

								<!-- Designs for Access -->
								<h2>First: Designs for Access</h2>
								<div class="gallery-grid">
									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image1.jpeg" alt="Navigation without senses" />
										<h3>1. Navigation Without Senses</h3>
										<p>This sound accessibility icon on a door indicates that the room is equipped with hearing assistance technology. For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, this visual marker signals that they can navigate and utilize the space without relying on their sense of hearing. The icon ensures that people know which rooms have accommodations before entering, making the campus more accessible for those with auditory impairments.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image2.jpeg" alt="Assistance design" />
										<h3>2. Forms of Assistance</h3>
										<p>This stool positioned near tall bookshelves provides crucial assistance for reaching books on higher shelves. Without this simple design element, anyone of shorter stature or with limited reach would struggle to access materials stored at the top. The stool allows for a wider range of people to independently retrieve books.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image3.jpeg" alt="Design for aging" />
										<h3>3. Design for Aging</h3>
										<p>This railing installed next to a toilet provides essential support for aging individuals or anyone with mobility challenges. As people age, balance and strength can decline, making simple tasks like using the restroom more difficult. The grab bar allows users to safely lower and raise themselves, preventing falls and maintaining independence. This thoughtful design consideration acknowledges the physical realities of aging bodies.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image4.jpeg" alt="Design for young children" />
										<h3>4. Design for Young Children</h3>
										<p>This Nintendo gaming room demonstrates design for young children through its inclusion of age-appropriate entertainment and a welcoming environment. Gaming spaces like this provide a safe, supervised area where children can engage with technology and socialize with peers. The choice of Nintendo systems, known for family-friendly content, shows consideration for younger users who may visit campus with parents or attend campus events.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image5.jpeg" alt="Wheeled mobile gear" />
										<h3>5. Wheeled Mobile Gear</h3>
										<p>This wheelchair-accessible lift provides vertical transportation between floors for individuals using wheelchairs, mobility scooters, or other wheeled equipment. Unlike stairs, which create an insurmountable barrier for wheeled mobility devices, this lift ensures that all levels of the building remain accessible. The design recognizes that not everyone can use stairs and provides an alternative that maintains independence and dignity for users with mobility devices.</p>
									</div>
								</div>

								<!-- Designs Against Access -->
								<h2>Designs Against Access</h2>
								<div class="gallery-grid">
									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image6.jpeg" alt="Physical barriers" />
										<h3>6. Physical Barriers</h3>
										<p>This emergency exit blocked by yellow and black caution tape and a wooden post creates a significant physical barrier that can prevent people who are wheelchair-accessible from using this exit route. This design choice prioritizes construction or repair work over maintaining clear egress paths, potentially putting building occupants at risk during emergencies.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image7.jpeg" alt="Lack of information" />
										<h3>7. Lack of Information</h3>
										<p>This library map demonstrates a lack of helpful information through its confusing 2D representation of a 3D space. Rather than clarifying the library's layout, the map actually makes navigation more difficult by failing to clearly indicate spatial relationships between areas. For someone unfamiliar with the building, this map provides insufficient information to successfully navigate the library, leaving users more confused than informed.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image8.jpeg" alt="Absence of help" />
										<h3>8. Absence of Help</h3>
										<p>This library room with high bookshelves but no stool represents a clear absence of assistance. Unlike the positive example in image 2, this space fails to provide any means for shorter individuals to access books on upper shelves. The absence of a stool, ladder, or staff assistance means that a significant portion of materials remains physically inaccessible to many users, forcing them to either ask for help or go without the resources they need.</p>
									</div>
								</div>

								<!-- Design Priorities -->
								<h2>Design Priorities in the Built Environment</h2>
								<div class="gallery-grid">
									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image9.jpeg" alt="Historical specificity" />
										<h3>9. Historical Specificity</h3>
										<p>This statue of Louis D. Brandeis embodies historical specificity by honoring the university's namesake and commemorating his legacy. Justice Brandeis was a groundbreaking Supreme Court Justice and champion of social justice, and this monument serves as a physical reminder of the values and history that shaped the institution. 
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image10.jpeg" alt="Environmental sustainability" />
										<h3>10. Environmental Sustainability</h3>
										<p>This dual-flush toilet demonstrates environmental sustainability through its water-saving design. The two-way lever system allows users to select different flush volumes depending on whether they're disposing of liquid or solid waste. By offering a lower-volume flush option for liquid waste, this toilet significantly reduces water consumption compared to traditional single-flush toilets. This thoughtful design prioritizes environmental conservation while maintaining functionality.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image11.jpeg" alt="Health and well-being" />
										<h3>11. Health and Well-being</h3>
										<p>This basketball hoop located near student dorms promotes health and well-being by providing convenient access to physical activity. By placing recreational facilities close to residential areas, the design encourages students to take breaks from studying and engage in exercise. The easy accessibility removes barriers to physical activity, making it more likely that students will maintain an active lifestyle, which is essential for both physical health and mental well-being during the demanding college years.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="gallery-item">
										<img src="Mini_Project_Pics/image12.jpeg" alt="Custom design priority" />
										<h3>12. Design for Religious Equality</h3>
										<p>The three chapels on Brandeis campus represent a unique design priority: religious equality and pluralism. These chapels are intentionally positioned so that none casts a shadow over the others, symbolizing equal respect and standing for different faiths. This architectural choice makes a powerful statement about inclusivity and demonstrates how thoughtful design can embody values of tolerance, diversity, and mutual respect in the built environment.</p>

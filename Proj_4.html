									<h1>Step 1:<br />
									What needs replacing?</h1>
								
								</header>
								<p><p>For this project, I chose to design a replacement item for a missing part of mine: my friend’s Wii gamecube slot flap! These pieces are infamous for snapping off of wii consoles, let alone one that is upwards of 16 years old.. Regardless, this Wii is special to me and I wanted it to have the finished look it once had years ago, so I designed the cover.

									<h1>Step 2:<br />
									Design!</h1>
									<p>The design process was quite easy, conceptually. I hopped on thinkverse and downloaded a reference wii gamecube flap model, and designed my flap through my own lens. At this point, I had become quite fluent in Fusion, and it wasn’t long before I had completed my first iteration of the design. Except for one fatal flaw… I totally designed the wrong port flap!! See I thought I was missing the gamecube MEMORY flap, the smaller of the 2 which sits aside the gamecube CONTROLLER PORT flap. Rookie mistake. So, I cleared my workstation and began on the port flap.

								<p><p>Luckily, both designs are essentially the same, excluding the length, so I was able to refer to my previous measurements to quickly get an accurate iteration of the flap. After some minor adjustments, my first iteration was ready to print. (as seen in the picture above on the left)

									<h1>Step Three:<br />
									Printing the Wii cover flap!:</h1>
									</header>
								</p>Printing this replacement piece was great! The first print iteration came out just as I expected. The issues arose when I went to remove the supports that held up the delicate, 2mm in width hinges for the flap.. The supports snapped right off, and the hinges went along with it!

								<p>With the help of our TA, I learned that I should have had the organic branches stem from the base plate, and not the 3d print itself. With this newfound knowledge, my next print iteration was born! This time around, I had no issues removing the new supports!

									Honorable mention iteration:</h1>
									</header>	
								</p> Before you see the final product, I thought I would share a nice anger moment I had with nintendo regarding my print. 
							</p> You see, because the hinges on the smaller flap are formatted to be both on the inside of the body, I had assumed that the larger flap would be the same.. Oh how wrong I was... 
								</header>							
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 4/wiipic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>	
							<p> Folks, please always double check the direction of your hinges before printing... What a waste!!</p>
 </p>							</header>							
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 4/wiipic03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After a simple pull over of the left hinge from the right side to the left, here is the cover, sitting almost perfectly atop of my Wii! Yes, it isn't perfectly alligned, but the flap is fully functional and I am quite proud with how accurate I was able to get the hinges to be!
								<p> This iteration can now be found on Thingverse! See for yourself: </p>

									<h1>Step three and a half: Wii-repair Tangent, For better or worse...<br />
									</h1>
									<p>While working on this project, Professor Krones made it known to me that he has an absolute endgame "iFixIt" kit in his office... Luckily for me, I had been itching to dig inside this Wii and see what's inside.
										</p>I also figured I may try to fix the annoying grinding noise that is the result of some friction in the disk reader. So, I got to work...
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 4/Wiipic04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>While it was fun and interesting taking the Wii apart, putting it back together is when I learned a valuable lesson called "remember where all the screws go or else you will close up the wii and have 6 extra screws..." 
									
								<p>Upon re-tearing the Wii down and watching back a Wii-reassembly video, I got the extra screw count down to just 2 screws! ..Not impressed? No fret, I plan on shell-swapping the wii once the AliExpress shipment delivers, so I will keep you posted on how that goes...

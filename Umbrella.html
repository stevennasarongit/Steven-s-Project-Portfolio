									<h1>part 1:<br />
									Brainstorming problems!</h1>
                                    </header>
									<p>When thinking about our project ideas in the context of “repairing the campus”, we decided it was best to walk around the campus and observe problems, in order to later find solutions for them. 
                                    <p> we first took to the SCC, where we interviewed the manager on which various maintenance issues are most neglected around campus.</p>
                                    <p>He led us to a drainage system in front of a door, and explained that when the drain overflows, there tend to be leaks which lead directly into the SCC theater, destroying props and damaging the ceiling. </p>
                                    </header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/leakpic01.JPG" alt="" /></div>
  </p>                                    <p> Admittedly, this issue seemed quite above the scope of the project. But, It did begin to get our braind churning in regards to other water related issues around campus...</p>

									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic01.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                                <p></p>After our jounrey through the SCC, we took a stroll in the main area of the science building, where we noticed a number of umbrellas laid out by the double doors, dripping water to the floor as they dried. 
                                <p>We realized that this raises multiple issues, such as a slipping hazard, and even mold growth on the carpets. Additionally, general organization of these randomly placed umbrellas will likely lead to less confusion when users retrieve their umbrellas.
                                    <p> Thus, we decided that umbrellas would be the subject of our project- specifically mitigating rain drippage which if left unnoticed can raise health concerns.</p>
                                <p> for a more in-depth analysis of our key issue, solutions, and sources please refer to our memo <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13w62b09obfpqgbFYDVKD7vO0ixo1uMYpWv6jKzKRwBA/edit?tab=t.fmru36i8rh2" target="_blank">

									<h1>part 2: Brainstorming solutions!<br />
									</h1>
                                    <p> at this point, we knew we wanted some type of umbrella holder, but we took to the whiteboard to get the most viable idea, utilisign the sticky note method from the very first day of class. full circle moment! </p>								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic02.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>After some back and forth, we all decided on one idea: A modular umbrella holder.</p>
								<p>This umbrella holder will contain a sponge at the bottom, sitting under a drain, which absorbs any water from the umbrella. (Our original design was to incorporate a plant at the base, so that the excess water would allow for it to grow and not be wasted, but this idea was scrapped as it was not practical). This allows for users to safely place their umbrella in a specific location, prohibiting unwanted water puddles and allowing users to retrieve their umbrellas easily. 
								<p>We wanted a modular design so that we could add/subtract holders depending on the need. This would be accomplished via a dovetail slide in component on either side of the box. </p>
								<p>We were pretty excited to start iterations for this idea, and we each got to work.</p>

									<h1>Version 0.5A:<br />
									The box</h1>
									<p>We decided to split up work so some would work on the dovtail, and some worked on the box part of the project. 
                         
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic03.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above you can see our first iteration of the umbrella holder. We focused on the drain aspect, using the circular pattern tool to create 9 holes for water to seep through. 
                                    <p>We decided that the design would be better if we could slide the drain in and out, in an event that it cracks, or wears out.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic04.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                                <p> And here is our first dovetail iteration!</p>
                                <p> the design process was simple: first, Jason measured the wall to find the right size of the dovetails. He then sketched 2 ends, a male and female, which were designed to fit nicely into eachother.</p>
                                <p> The dovetail ends fit well into eachother, but it was difficult to tell how well they would slide into eachother, as it was not extruded.</p>
                                <p> with the box design and dovetail, as well as thoughts towards a removable drain, we then begun our official V1 iteration!</p>

                                </header>
								<p>The first version was a good starting point, and showed us parts that we did well, and where we can improve on the print for the next iteration. The dovetails (made by Jason) were solid, but needed a little more tolerance because the fit was a bit too tight. Same issue with the slide in drain design. Additionally, the drain showed some stability issues, as I essentially ripped it out of the design, leaving behind a hole in the right side of the rectangle, which is not ideal as we will see in the holder's next version.
</p>
                            <p> for the next version, we prioratized tolerance and printing to scale, so we can see this bad boy in action!</p>

									<h1>Version 2:<br />
									Functional design!(?)</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic06.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                                <p> Version 2 was our first usable design! From the previous design, we increased the tolerance of the dovetails & drain piece, and upscaled the design so it can fit retractable umbrellas!</p>
                                <p>We also got to see how the “modular” aspect turned out at full scale, and I am pleased to say that it works wonderfully! The dovetail tolerance allowed for a snug fit between holders. </p>
								<p>While this iteration was mostly a success, we can't win all the battles.. 
                                <p>The structural issue I mentioned from the previous design, was amplified in the upscaled version, and caused a break in the print material on the right side where the drain slots in. 
                                <p> From this learning experience, I took it upon myself to redesign the drainage piece to fit properly into the rectangle, which I will explain in more detail below.

									<h1>Inter-version iterations:<br />
									alternative drain holder</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Up until now, we implemented a slide-in mechanism for the drain to fit properly into the rectangle. Unfortunately, the way I designed this slide joint caused there to be a gaping horizontal hole when the drain was taken out. This leads to breaks in the joint when printing at full scale, which is undesirable.</p>
                                <p>To fix this issue, I took away the slide in shelf by extruding the walls, and adding in 4 pillars at the base of the rectangle which the drain could rest on. 
	After tuning up the design, I went ahead and printed it at a small scale to see if the design worked as expected.
                        </header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic07.jpg" alt="" /></div>
    <p> Luckily, this was a successful print! The 4 pillars worked well as an alternative to the shelf slide-in design, and now there were no unwanted holes, reinforcing the design's strength! yippee!</p>
</p> Although we did not end up utilizing this design, I was proud to find a working solution for a problem that we could have implemented :)

									<h1>Version 3: Wood & PLA, Unite!<br />
									(Makings of the final version)!</h1>
									<p>During one of our workshop classes, professor Krones asked why we never considered wood laser cutting in our design iterations. We figured that wood wouldn’t fare well with water, and PLA was the best material for this project, but we were convinced to give the laser cut wood a go. Max designed the wooden box with proper teeth to fit in each side, and have the drain fit into the wood nicely.</p>
                                </header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images final project/umbrellapic08.png" alt="" /></div> 
                                <p> It's always cool to see past project's lessons applied to new ones. In this case, I'm sure Max recalled the skills necessary to make this holder iteration from the wooden teeth cutout for his radio encasing back in project 3.</p>   


                                <p>Jason then realized that we would still want to keep our original dovetail design to preserve the modular feature  so he began prototyping a “hook on” element to the dovetail which would be inserted onto the wooden rectangle and function just as it did with the original PLA design. This way we can perform “rapid prototyping” to scale with efficiency, as wood cutouts take way less time to complete than standard 3D printing. 
        
                                </p>

                                     It worked! Mostly. We assembled the wood box, which was lacking tolerance, and needed tape to stay put. We then added Jason’s PLA dovetail, which fit snug onto the wood! This resulted in a solid final prototype: A wooden umbrella holder with modular PLA dovetail attachments.

								<p>From here, its just a matter of sliding on more umbrella holders and inserting sponges at the bottom for this final project to be ready for use! Hope you enjoyed reading through our design process for our final project!  </p>

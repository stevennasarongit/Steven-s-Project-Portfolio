									<h1>First:<br />
									Making a Radio!</h1>
								
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>Building the radio was the most fun part of the project. I really enjoyed following the instructions to solder in each of the various components and I was pleased to see that all of me and Judah’s work resulted in a (somewhat) functional radio! 

								<p>I say somewhat functional because we were never able to hear any music or live broadcasting... only static... But it turns on, and has volume!

									<h1>Second:<br />
									Measuring the Radio!</h1>
									<p>In order to effectively design a case for this beautiful radio, we must take precise measurements with our handy-dandy calipers!
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>The radio measurements went well. We used the calipers to find the dimensions of each button, the battery, speaker, antenna, and the radio itself, so we can effectively make a fitted case for the radio. The measurements were as follows: 

								<p>BODY:
Length: 133.42mm (R: 133mm)
Height: 87mm 
Width: (With Knob) 41.59mm (R: 42mm)
Width: (Without Knob) 20mm
Width: (Without anything) 2mm


								<p>Battery: 
Length: 54.25mm (R: 54mm)
Height: 29.29mm (R: 29mm)
Width: 19.22mm (R: 19mm)
Location: 58.63mm from the left, 31.90mm from bottom

								<p>yellow/red Button dimensions: 11.96mm

Yellow Button location: 40.53mm from the left, 78.40mm from the bottom

Red button location: 54mm from the left, 78.40mm from the bottom

Silver knob location: 125.67mm from the left, 75.15mm from the bottom

Silver knob dimensions: 14.85mm by , probably consistent throughout it… 

Speaker dimensions: 35.66mm x35.66mm

Speaker location: 42.58mm from the bottom. 42.83mm from the right

								<p>I will admit, the way we described the measurements, specifically relative to the body (30mm from the left), made replicating the components in CAD quite difficult. For reference, Judah and I decided to make a replica radio in CAD and then design the case to fit around the emulated radio.

									<h1>Three:<br />
									Designing and Printing the case!:</h1>
									</header>
									<p> design process was tedious- Judah and I had to ensure that all of the function points were accessible such as the buttons and knob, and also allow for the battery port to be accessed, and speaker to be heard. To do so, We decided to "simulate" the radio in CAD, and then design the radio case on the simulated radio. 
									
									<p>For the first iteration of the case, I cut out holes where we projected the buttons and other function points of the radio to be, and designed a cool grill for the speaker. 
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic04.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>When I was home for the holidays, I decided to make use of my time by printing the case with my home printer, our lovely (6 yr old) ender 3! What I didn’t know was that our printer had not been used in quite some time, and was in no condition to print… The board was not calibrated, nor could it be (the screws under the bed were missing the tightening mechanism). I even replaced the parts to level the bed, but was met with another issue regarding the filament– It was jammed in the printer.. Needless to say, I did not accomplish printing the case at home.
 </p>							</header>
									<p> And here is my tragically useless Ender 3... 
							
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic05.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Thanks for almost working, old one...
								<p>To the people reading, take this as a lesson: Maintain your printers!!!</p>
								<p>
								<p>Once back on campus, I was able to print the printer with one of the lovely, highly maintenanced classroom printers and began the print with no problem (thanks Sam!). When I checked on the print the next day, it was all done and ready to encase a radio!</p>
								<p></p>
									<p>Finally, after measuring, designing, and failing...
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above you can see my gorgeous 3D printed shell sitting alongside our radio!
									<p> Oh? why is the radio not in the shell? Definitely not because I didn't print it wide enough...</p>
									<p> No fret, I reiterated and designed the new and improved radio case that accounts for the width!
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic06.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>....Which still was not wide enough to house the radio.. </p>
								<p>If I were to tweak this design, I would refer to my measurements a little more closely and reevaluate  what my tolerence would be (apparently, it should have been much lower) to yeild a more accurate, useful design.</p>

									<h1>Four: Designing and Subtracting! (Yay lasers!)<br />
									</h1>
									<p>While I was working on the 3D print case, my good teammate Judah was designing the wood casing, which has no tolerance for standing objects. 
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic07.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Judah broke down each face of the casing, and laid it out for me to add notches on so the wooden panels can attach to each other. 
									
								<p>Given that we were short on time, I decided to wing the notches.. It seemed relatively simple in my mind, and the execution felt easy, but an easy process does not yield a positive result.. </p>
							</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic08.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>	It seems I forgot to account for the thickness of the wood, 3mm, when designing these notches, 2mm. As a result, the notches wouldn’t fit correctly, and the casing was rendered useless. Above is our best attempt at assembly.</p>
								<p> Besides this error, I believe I got quite far based on common sense and how I would imagine two faces to interlock with eachother. Nonetheless, tutorial would have certainly benefitted me.  </p>
								<p> Here is our first iteration, which did not include the notches and was a rough design:</p>

						<h1> Conclusion:
						</h1>
							<p>This project was a long time in the making, yet some of my results happen to not reflect that. The holidays certainly took its toll on this project. Either way, I am proud with the effort I put into this project in terms of workarounds I committed to in order to stay on task (going to OH, trying to print at home, starting prints before class...)</p>
							<p>Like any project, there are things I wish I did differently. I do wish that I paid more attention to my measurements, and respected them a little more when finalizing my 3D prints. </p>
							<p>I also would have liked to successfully design notches that connect the wooden pieces of the case together.</p>
							<p>Things don't go the way you plan. Regardless, its important that I learn from the mistakes I made in this project, so I may not revisit them for future projects.</p>

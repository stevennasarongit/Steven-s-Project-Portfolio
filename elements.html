									<h1>First:<br />
									Making a Radio!</h1>
								
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>Building the radio was the most fun part of the project. I really enjoyed following the instructions to solder in each of the various components and I was pleased to see that all of me and Judah’s work resulted in a (somewhat) functional radio! 

								<p>I say somewhat functional because we were never able to hear any music or live broadcasting... only static... But it turns on, and has volume!

									<h1>Second:<br />
									Measuring the Radio!</h1>
									<p>In order to effectively design a case for this beautiful radio, we must take precise measurements with our handy-dandy calipers!
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/pic02.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>The radio measurements went well. We used the calipers to find the dimensions of each button, the battery, speaker, antenna, and the radio itself, so we can effectively make a fitted case for the radio. The measurements were as follows: 

								<p>BODY:
Length: 133.42mm (R: 133mm)
Height: 87mm 
Width: (With Knob) 41.59mm (R: 42mm)
Width: (Without Knob) 20mm
Width: (Without anything) 2mm


								<p>Battery: 
Length: 54.25mm (R: 54mm)
Height: 29.29mm (R: 29mm)
Width: 19.22mm (R: 19mm)
Location: 58.63mm from the left, 31.90mm from bottom

								<p>yellow/red Button dimensions: 11.96mm

Yellow Button location: 40.53mm from the left, 78.40mm from the bottom

Red button location: 54mm from the left, 78.40mm from the bottom

Silver knob location: 125.67mm from the left, 75.15mm from the bottom

Silver knob dimensions: 14.85mm by , probably consistent throughout it… 

Speaker dimensions: 35.66mm x35.66mm

Speaker location: 42.58mm from the bottom. 42.83mm from the right

								<p>I will admit, the way we described the measurements, specifically relative to the body (30mm from the left), made replicating the components in CAD quite difficult. For reference, Judah and I decided to make a replica radio in CAD and then design the case to fit around the emulated radio.

									<h1>Three:<br />
									Designing and Printing the case!:</h1>
									<p>After many long hours of measuring...
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 3/radiopic03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above you can see my gorgeous 3D printed shell sitting alongside our radio!
									<p> Oh? why is the radio not in the shell? Definitely not because I didn't print it wide enough...</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic04.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>And here is the TinkerCAD design I came up with. I essentially duplicated and merged the model to be twice the size. I also duped the nunchuck holders (seen on the sides) which seemed just fine at first, but ended up causing functional issues down the road...  I also discovered a fun design tool: custom text! After a quick YoutTube search, I was able to find out how to implement a "Wii" font, and personalize the holder for our apartment (we call it "Cappys").</p>
								<p>In truth, the most challenging part of the process was fitting everything onto the printing bed! To do so, I had to cut up the various components so I could freely move them and adjust their positioning. If you ever have a print that seems to not fit, the cutting tool will be your best friend. After cutting up my objects, I settled on putting the wiimote holder diagonal, and the nunchuck holders scattered to the left and right of it. This seemed to make the software happy.</p>
								<p>Here's how it looked on PrusaSlicer:</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic05.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>4 hours later, here's the finished product:</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The print was mostly successful, with a minor mishap. When I copied the nunchuck holders over to the sides of the model, my calculations were quite rough, and it seems that one side was not completely adherent to the wall of the model. As a result, the holders disconnected with minimal pressure. As you can maybe tell, A little hot glue and elbow grease makes it seem valid, but I had another thing coming my way...</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the holes of the nunchuck holders appeared to be too small for the holder to slide in property, rendering them useless. If I were to fix this problem. I would make the holes for the holder a bit larger, and be certain that the holding piece is completely adhered to the wall. Otherwise, the base where the controllers would go looks perfect, and I am happy with the custom font I put in. </p>

									<h1>2.4:<br />
									Fusion Remix:</h1>
									<p>Modifying a "Beerio Kart" trophy to be my own, via Fusion.</p>
									For those unaware, Beerio Kart is a common drinking game among college students in which you play Mario Kart with a twist of finishing 1 beer per round. If you do not finish the beer by the finish line, you are eliminated!
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic08.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As if basking in your drunken glory wasn't enough- The Beerio Kart trophy allows for a splendid memorabilia to showcase on your nightstand! </p>
								<p>For this project, I wanted to make the Beer more personalized, so I took out the boring old beer mug, and replaced it with Guiness! Besides its asthetic look, Guiness also happened to be my late Grandfather Mori's favorite Beer A"H. I strongly believe he would've gotten a kick out of this.  </p>
								<p>After some trial and error with conic curves (and a fun math lesson from Professor Krones about them), Professor Krones suggested I import a PDF of the guiness to model a sketch off of- This was an amazing idea!- I was able to easily trace the glass, and extrude it into a 3D object to add to my trophy! </p>
								<p>Another tool I utilized was the reference tool in sketch, where you can select an object to start as an outline in a sketch, and essentially remake it 1 to 1. This was important when making the eyes of the trophy, as the ones I ripped from the original model had missing depth to them, and I couldn’t edit them back to how they were. </p>
								<p>Here is the Fusion screenshot:</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic09.png" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>And the PrusaSlicer:</p>
							</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic11.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The model is quite structurally sound, with only minor overhangs, so I wasn't very concerned that it would fail. Regardless, I always print with the "structural" setting on, as opposed to "speed" mode.</p>
								<p>This print, similar to the tinkercad remix, was successful with minor flaws. Firstly, the eyes on the model were not attached to the face like I had thought. Being that this is a recurring flaw in my designs, I will be sure to pay close attention to detail regarding object adherence. </p>
								<p>Additionally, the custom text on the plaque is too small for the printer to accurately print, so I would need to size that part up. Otherwise, the print looks great, and I am relatively satisfied with how it came out.</p>

								<p>I know that was a lot... Thanks for checking out "Project 2"! Stay tuned for Project 3, I heard we may be soldering... </p>

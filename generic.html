									<h1>2.1:<br />
									TinkerCad Toilet!</h1>
									<p>For this part in the project, we were asked to create a 3D model similar in difficulty to the ring from the tutorial. I decided that A toilet would be perfect for the task.  </p>
									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic01.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>The design process was fun. I especially enjoyed using the "hole" tool to make a urinel built into the toilet base!</p>
								<p>I like how intuitive the design process is for TinkerCAD. At no point did I feel I was stuck. The tutorials were very straightforward; once I was done watching, I got right to work and finshed this mastepiece within 30 minutes.

									<h1>2.2:<br />
									Fusion Toilet!</h1>
									<p>Here, you can see the Fusion version of the toilet I made. 
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic02.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p><p>"Fusion" should be renamed to "Patience Tester"... </p>
								<p>Design wise, tinkercad was very simple compared to fusion. Everything was intuitive, and I was able to design my toilet more or less to how I imagined it. I found the tutorials easier to follow in tinkercad. The fusion tutorials were stretched out and time consuming. I suppose the extra time put in does show a return, as the fusion design showed more precision. The spheres had perfect rounding in the stl display, compared to the tinkercad spherical shapes, which showed small square shapes to make up the sphere.</p>
								<p>Navigating Fusion was also quite tricky. I found myself trying to use the TinkerCAD camera controls for Fusion, which led to more excess time wasted. Thankfully, our TA taught me that there is actually a setting to make the controls just like TinkerCAD!</p>
								<p>Overall, I was pretty happy with how this metalic, spherical toilet came out. It was by no means easy, but through the struggle I know I gained good foundational skills for this professional 3D modeling program.</p>

									<h1>2.3:<br />
									TinkerCAD Remix:</h1>
									<p>Modifying an inconvenient-only-2-wiimote holder into something more...
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic03.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above you can see the very professional sketch of my modification to the Wiimote+nunchuck holder. The original design had only 2 slots for wiimotes and 2 nunchuck holders. We have 4 of each in our apartment, so that just didn't cut it for me.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic04.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>And here is the TinkerCAD design I came up with. I essentially duplicated and merged the model to be twice the size. I also duped the nunchuck holders (seen on the sides) which seemed just fine at first, but ended up causing functional issues down the road...  I also discovered a fun design tool: custom text! After a quick YoutTube search, I was able to find out how to implement a "Wii" font, and personalize the holder for our apartment (we call it "Cappys").</p>
								<p>In truth, the most challenging part of the process was fitting everything onto the printing bed! To do so, I had to cut up the various components so I could freely move them and adjust their positioning. If you ever have a print that seems to not fit, the cutting tool will be your best friend. After cutting up my objects, I settled on putting the wiimote holder diagonal, and the nunchuck holders scattered to the left and right of it. This seemed to make the software happy.</p>
								<p>Here's how it looked on PrusaSlicer:</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic05.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>4 hours later, here's the finished product:</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The print was mostly successful, with a minor mishap. When I copied the nunchuck holders over to the sides of the model, my calculations were quite rough, and it seems that one side was not completely adherent to the wall of the model. As a result, the holders disconnected with minimal pressure. As you can maybe tell, A little hot glue and elbow grease makes it seem valid, but I had another thing coming my way...</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the holes of the nunchuck holders appeared to be too small for the holder to slide in property, rendering them useless. If I were to fix this problem. I would make the holes for the holder a bit larger, and be certain that the holding piece is completely adhered to the wall. Otherwise, the base where the controllers would go looks perfect, and I am happy with the custom font I put in. </p>

									<h1>2.4:<br />
									Fusion Remix:</h1>
									<p>Modifying a "Beerio Kart" trophy to be my own, via Fusion.</p>
									For those unaware, Beerio Kart is a common drinking game among college students in which you play Mario Kart with a twist of finishing 1 beer per round. If you do not finish by the finish line, you are eliminated!
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic08.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As if basking in your drunken glory wasn't enough- The Beerio Kart trophy allows for a splendid memorabilia to showcase on your nightstand! </p>
								<p>For this project, I wanted to make the Beer more personalized, so I took out the boring old beer mug, and replaced it with Guiness! Besides its asthetic look, Guiness also happened to be my late Grandfather Mori's favorite Beer A"H. I strongly believe he would've gotten a kick out of this.  </p>
								<p>After some trial and error with conic curves (and a fun math lesson from Professor Krones about them), Professor Krones suggested I import a PDF of the guiness to model a sketch off of- This was an amazing idea!- I was able to easily trace the glass, and extrude it into a 3D object to add to my trophy! </p>
								<p>Another tool I utilized was the reference tool in sketch, where you can select an object to start as an outline in a sketch, and essentially remake it 1 to 1. This was important when making the eyes of the trophy, as the ones I ripped from the original model had missing depth to them, and I couldnâ€™t edit them back to how they were. </p>
								<p>Here is the Fusion screenshot:</p>

								<p>And the PrusaSlicer:</p>
							</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images proj 2/pic11.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The model is quite structurally sound, with only minor overhangs, so I wasn't very concerned that it would fail. Regardless, I always print with the "structural" setting on, as opposed to "speed" mode.</p>
								<p>This print, similar to the tinkercad remix, was successful with minor flaws. Firstly, the eyes on the model were not attached to the face like I had thought. Being that this is a recurring flaw in my designs, I will be sure to pay close attention to detail regarding object adherence. </p>
								<p>Additionally, the custom text on the plaque is too small for the printer to accurately print, so I would need to size that part up. Otherwise, the print looks great, and I am relatively satisfied with how it came out.</p>
